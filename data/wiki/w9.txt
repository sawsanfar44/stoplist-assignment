A social media influencer,[1][2][3] also known as an online influencer,[4][5][6] or simply influencer,[7][8][9] is a person who builds a grassroots online presence through engaging content such as photos, videos, and updates. This is done by using direct audience interaction to establish authenticity, expertise, and appeal, and by standing apart from traditional celebrities by growing their platform through social media rather than pre-existing fame.[10][11] The modern referent of the term is commonly a paid role in which a business entity pays for the social media influence-for-hire activity to promote its products and services, known as influencer marketing.[12] Types of influencers include fashion influencer, travel influencer, and virtual influencer, and they involve content creators[13][14][15] and streamers.[16][17][18]

Some influencers are associated primarily with specific social media apps such as TikTok,[19] Instagram,[20][21] or Pinterest; many influencers are also considered internet celebrities. As of 2023, Instagram is the social media platform businesses spend the most advertising money towards marketing with influencers.[22] However, influencers can have an impact on any social media network.A social media influencer,[1][2][3] also known as an online influencer,[4][5][6] or simply influencer,[7][8][9] is a person who builds a grassroots online presence through engaging content such as photos, videos, and updates.
