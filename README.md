#  Stoplist Assignment

##  Overview
This project analyzes a collection of Wikipedia-style text files and builds a **stoplist** —  
a ranked list of the most frequent words that commonly appear across all files.

The goal is to identify and exclude these high-frequency words in future text analysis.
